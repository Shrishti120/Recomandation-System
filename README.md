# Netflix Movie Recomandation-System

The main objective of this project was to build a Recommendation system that
could predict the ratings given by a user to a movie based on the previous
ratings given by other users to the same movie. To achieve this I used the
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm and calculated the ratings of
those movies which were unavailable. Finally using Mean Squared Error (MSE) I
measured the accuracy of the algorithm.
